** Configuration

You can modify these variables at the top of the script:

#+begin_src lua
-- Maximum number of characters for bookmark name
local maxChar = 100
-- Number of bookmarks to be displayed per page
local bookmarksPerPage = 10
-- Whether to close the Bookmarker menu after loading a bookmark
local closeAfterLoad = true
-- Whether to close the Bookmarker menu after replacing a bookmark
local closeAfterReplace = true
-- Whether to ask for confirmation to replace a bookmark
local confirmReplace = false
-- Whether to ask for confirmation to delete a bookmark
local confirmDelete = false
-- The rate (in seconds) at which the bookmarker refreshes its interface
local rate = 1.5
-- The filename for the bookmarks file
local bookmarkerName = "bookmarker.json"
-- Whether to use fuzzy search (more forgiving) or exact search
local useFuzzySearch = true
-- Font size for the bookmarker menu
local fontSize = 8
